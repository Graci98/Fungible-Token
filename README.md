![application_image](Images/application_image.png)

## Overview

#### Created an ERC-20 compliant fungible token called KaseiCoin (KAI) to be minted through a crowdsale contract based on the Solidity library's Crowdsale contract. It will send Ether to the contract and receive KAI tokens in return. The contract will automate the minting of tokens and distribute them to buyers in a single transaction.

## Instructions 
1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
4. Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain
